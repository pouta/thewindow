I will first solve this using wolfram alpha in order to answer questions, meanwhile I will collect all the examples in order to train a NLC (Natural Language Classifier) to understand the questions and answer them correctly.

This NLC will also understand where to answer and get the next questions by parsing the response from each endpoint.

##How to start the app:

using heroku:

Use the command: heroku local

using node:

Use the command: node index.js


## TODO:

Wolfram Solution: done

Collection of examples: in progress

Using NLC: todo
